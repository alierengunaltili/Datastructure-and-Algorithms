I realized that operator overload calls copy constructor and destructors
therefore, I put my real print function inside of my copy constructor. 
I make the insert and search functions by considering the properties of 
Binary Search Tree data structure. 
I take the filename argv1 and n as a argv2 just like the assignment says.
Thus, user type the filename after near of the executable; (./hw2 test.txt 4)
I calculate the isFull by storing the number of leaf and internal nodes.
I calculate the isComp by giving index to node level by level by considering gaps.
After finding max index, I calculate the total sum of indices if the tree is complete.
Then I compare this sum with the one I calculate with my valid nodes in my tree.
